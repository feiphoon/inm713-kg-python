Task 3.1: Use a text editor to create triples in Turtle format. Create:
2
• An entity that represents yourself of type foaf:Person.
• Triples for your name and surname.
• Triples for your city and country of birth.
• Triple(s) with the list of languages you speak.
• Triples describing your past or current employer/university, stating the date of
start and end (if applicable).
Tips:
• Select a suitable namespace for your entities.
• Define prefixes.
• Reuse vocabulary if possible (e.g., http://dbpedia.org/resource/Spain,
https://dbpedia.org/ontology/birthPlace, http://xmlns.com/
foaf/0.1/name).
• You may need to use reification or a n-ary relationship.
• Give a .ttl extension to your created file.
Task 3.2: Load the created .ttl file with RDFLib or Jena API and print the triples in the
graph. This may give errors if the created triples have not been properly formatted.
